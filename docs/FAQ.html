    Everybody talks about the console ... how do I get there ?</i></b></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First you 
    should start Halflife with the parameter &quot;-console&quot;. If you have 
    a shortcut for halflife, counterstrike or DoD, just right click on it and 
    select properties. There you'll find an edit box containing the name of the 
    executable. <i>( for example : &quot;c:\sierra\half-life\hl.exe&quot; )</i> 
    Now you just add &quot;-console&quot; there, that you get <i>&quot;c:\sierra\half-life\hl.exe 
    -console &quot;. </i>If you have a shortcut for Counterstrike for example 
    it should then look like<i> &quot;c:\sierra\half-life\hl.exe -game cstrike 
    -console&quot;. </i>When all this is done, you can access the console from 
    within the game with the '^'-key, i.e. left of the &quot;1&quot;.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>2. 
    When I start a Multiplayer game all slots are filled up one after the other 
    by bots. But I want to have a free slot and they'll even come &quot;back&quot; 
    when I kick one !</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just 
          look in your cstrike/joebot/bot.cfg file. There you'll find an entry 
          called &quot;max_bots&quot;. Set this value to 0 and no bot will appear 
          automatically.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>3. 
          I started a multiplayer game, but there are no other players ... what's 
          wrong ?</i></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
          no bots are added automatically, you have to add them manually by typing 
          &quot;addbot&quot; in the console. Then a bot will be added. For further 
          information take a look at the readme.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>4. 
          I already tried addbot, but then I always get the message that this 
          is an unknown command ?!</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          looks like the installation hasn't been really successful. Have you 
          really selected your halflife directory for installing JoeBOT ?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><i>5. 
          The bots are running through the maps, but they seem to fly, the legs 
          are funny spread to the sides ! What did JoeBOT do to my beloved halflife 
          ?</i></b> </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JoeBOT 
          did nothing to your halflife. Just make sure you have the newest 
          version of Halflife, at least 1.1.0.4, for CS1.1 at least 1.1.0.6</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>6. 
          I like to play as a counterterrorist against a whole team of terrorists. 
          I already managed it to add only terrorist bots (&quot;addbot 1&quot;) 
          , but after some rounds, some of them change to my team. What do I have 
          to do to avoid this ?</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just 
          open your console and type &quot;mp_autoteambalance 0&quot; and &quot;mp_limitteams 
          0&quot;. Now you won't have this problem anymore. If you want to change 
          this variables in every game, you can also just add this 2 commands 
          to ur cstrike/autoexec.cfg</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>7. 
Do Flashbangs and Smokegrenades affect the bots ? ... and how ?</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

Yes, the bots are affected by both types of grenades, flashbangs and smokegrenades. After a flashbang attack they won't see anything for some time, this is very similar to the effect on human players. Higher skilled bots will try to shoot where they have heard or seen an enemy before being blinded.<br>
The effect of smokegrenades is faked. It's _really_ difficult to detect all the single smoke puffs, therefore it's seen as a plane of smoke in which the grenade lies. If the enemy bot is behind a smoke grenade, it won't be able to detect you instantly, you have appr. 4 seconds to run in the sight of an enemy behind a smokegrenade without being detected. But of course the radius of the grenade is limited and you'll be detected almost instantly by muzzle flashs, i.e. when you shoot yourself, no matter what direction. ( btw, this is the same with being prone in DoD, but the time of not being detectable is configurable in bot_skill.txt )

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>Why 
          is this bot called JoeBOT ? That name doesn't sound very creative !</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">LOL, 
          no it's not at all creative. When I began writing my bot, I wanted to 
          call it NNBot, but then some weeks later I realized that there was already 
          a bot called NNBot. So I decided to name it temporarily JoeBOT, derived 
          from my real name, Johannes. And till now it hasn't been changed ....</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i><b>Hey, 
          stupid names you got there for your bots ... Miststueck, Karla, etc. 
          .... WTF is that ?</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*g* 
          First only some ppl from my school knew JoeBOT. The names are all nicknames 
          for pupils from my class or teachers.</font></p>
